# Coming Soon...

We have a working implementation which needs to be cleaned up and packaged
as a standalone django app. The source tree will be populated once that is
done.

A rough list of features we intend to implemented is embedded somewhere
within TODO.md

# Dependencies

By default, we use the markdown filter in django.contrib.markup. This
requires:
* python markdown (http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown)

# Settings

DOCCOMMENT_PARSER_MODULE
DOCCOMMENT_PERMISSION_MODULE

DOCCOMMENT_MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS
DOCCOMMENT_MARKDOWN_SAFEMODE

# Disclaimer

I'm relatively new to Django, so I'm sure there will be lots of room for
improvement. 

Feel free to get in touch if you have comments, suggestions, patches, or
would like to get involved with the project.
